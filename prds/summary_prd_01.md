# Media File Manager - Project Implementation Summary (Phase 1)

This document summarizes the work completed in the initial phase of the Media File Manager project.

## 1. Project Initialization and Scaffolding

*   **Directory Structure:** The complete project directory structure has been created as per the `project_structure.md` document. This includes dedicated directories for source code (`src`), tests (`tests`), configuration (`config`), documentation (`docs`), and scripts (`scripts`).
*   **File Creation:** All necessary Python files, configuration files, and documentation stubs have been created. This provides a solid foundation for the project's development.
*   **Dependency Management:** The project's dependencies have been defined in `pyproject.toml`, `setup.py`, `requirements.txt`, and `requirements-dev.txt`. This ensures that the project can be easily set up in any environment.
*   **Virtual Environment:** A virtual environment has been created using `uv` to isolate the project's dependencies and avoid conflicts with other projects.
*   **Dependency Installation:** All the project's dependencies have been installed using `uv pip install`.

## 2. Core Functionality Implementation

The initial implementation of the core functionality has been completed. This includes the following components:

*   **`main.py`:** The main entry point of the application.
*   **`utils/config.py`:** A configuration manager that handles loading, validation, and access to configuration settings from YAML files.
*   **`utils/logger.py`:** A logging utility that provides centralized logging configuration for the application.
*   **`utils/file_utils.py`:** A set of utility functions for common file operations.
*   **`utils/backup.py`:** A backup manager that handles creating, managing, and restoring backups of media files.
*   **`core/file_processor.py`:** The main file processor that orchestrates the entire file processing workflow, including validation, backup creation, metadata extraction, file renaming, and metadata updating.
*   **`core/metadata_handler.py`:** A metadata handler that is responsible for extracting, processing, and updating metadata in media files.
*   **`core/file_renamer.py`:** A file renamer that is responsible for generating new filenames based on metadata and performing the renaming operation.
*   **`core/validator.py`:** A file validator that is responsible for validating media files.
*   **`media/format_detector.py`:** A format detector that provides functionality to detect and validate different media file formats.
*   **`media/audio_processor.py`:** An audio processor that handles audio-specific operations including metadata extraction, modification, and file processing.
*   **`media/video_processor.py`:** A placeholder for the video processor has been created.
*   **`cli/interface.py`:** A command-line interface for the application using the `click` framework.
*   **`cli/commands.py`:** The CLI commands for the application.

## 3. Initial Run and Debugging

The application has been run, and several import and path-related issues have been identified and fixed. The application is now in a runnable state.

## 4. Next Steps

The next steps in the project's development will be to:

*   Implement the video processing logic in `media/video_processor.py`.
*   Implement the `preview`, `restore`, and `info` commands in `cli/commands.py`.
*   Write comprehensive unit and integration tests for all the implemented components.
*   Create the documentation for the project.
